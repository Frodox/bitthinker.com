=====

A Markdown file-based CMS.

[Check out the starter video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GLMe371RuI), or [read the wiki for in-depth documenation](https://github.com/PhileCMS/Phile/wiki/_pages).

### Origins

This project is based on [Pico CMS v0.8](https://github.com/gilbitron/Pico/commit/aa59661ff81dd52c3a2596988372a214b0fc31b9 "0.8 Commit") by [Gilbert Pellegrom](https://github.com/gilbitron).

The desire to fork the project from Pico, came when a few community members wanted to contribute more and increase the rate of development progress.

**Note: Plugins for Pico are not interchangeable with Phile.**

### Why use this over Pico?

Here is a small list of differences in design from Pico:

* OOP based (classes)
* Events system
* Parser Overloading
* Template Engine Overloading
* [PSR-0 Compliant](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md)
* Uses Composer
